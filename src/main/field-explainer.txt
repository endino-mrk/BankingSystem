HOW THE FIELD CLASS WORKS (AT LEAST FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND)
- just a helper file to help me understand it better

field - any information received by user input that will be used in the Banking System
example: In Account class - accountNumber, ownerFName, ownerLName, etc.

CLASS DEFINITION
class Field<T, E>
:T - generics param for the type of the field
:E - generics param for the type of the field threshold

CLASS ATTRIBUTES
: Class<T> fieldType - type of field which is of any Class (refers to ClassName.class which is the actual class at runtime, not just an instance of the class)
- <T> placeholder for the actual type of the field

: String fieldName - name of the field (ex: accountNumber)

: T fieldValue - actual value of the field received from user input
- set through method setFieldValue()
- T placeholder for the actual type of the value (can be of any type)

: final E threshold - certain condition to be met by the fieldValue in order to be considered as a valid value
- example: in StringFieldLengthValidator.validate(accountNumber, 16)
accountNumber must have at least 16 character else it is invalid

: final FieldValidator<T,E> fieldValidator - validator class used to validate the fieldValue (used in method setFieldValue())
